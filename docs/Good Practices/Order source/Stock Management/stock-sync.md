# Virtual stock synchronisation

We recommend to not interact directly with the ressource to avoid throttling with a GET request on **product/{id}** or **/products** but we actively recommend to use Webhooks

## Configure your webhook

We recommend to follow this [article](https://developer.shippingbo.com/docs/webhook/)

## The notification

Everytime a stock movement has been done on a product we will call your endpoint with the name of the ressource, a seriliazed **Product** and an object with reason of the call: **additional_data**
You will find the new value of the stock in the field `stock`

```json
{
  object_class: "Product"
  object: {
    id: 922957134
    created_at: "2021-05-18T09:58:40+00:00"
    updated_at: "2022-06-30T14:53:00+00:00"
    source: "Manual product"
    source_ref: "sku-test-50"
    user_ref: "sku-test-50"

    supplier_product_ids: []
    pack_components: []
  },
  additional_data: {
    field: "stock"
    from: 10
    to: 5
  },
  hook_info: {}
}
```

## Update the stock

Once the notification is received, you can update the stock on your website and leave it available or not on your catalog

## ðŸ”¥ Caution: can be spammy ðŸ”¥

The number of call is equal to the number of stock movement on your Shippingbo account. Your server must be ready to receive calls as much as necessary

If you server dot not respond Shippingbo can turn off the webhook to avoid spamming, protect your server and keep it safe

We recommend to manage all requests asynchronously to avoid long response time and timeout
